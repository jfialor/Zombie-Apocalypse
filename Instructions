ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE

The world has been taken over by crazy scary zombies, 
your task is to survive in this dangerous zone.

Use the arrow keys to move your champion
Use the space bar to shoot bullets

Make sure no zombies touch you, or else you get 
weakened until you finally become one of them!

Complete the three levels to save the world....
but sadly with no humans left but you.

If you're having too much trouble, here is a cheat
code to help out. Press M, C and G together to turn your 
ordinary hand gun into a machine gun (hold space bar to 
shoot continuously).

Another cool cheat is pressing U T and M together puts 
you in the Ultimate Tank Mode, where you get to use 
bullets that destroy almost any zombie with one hit.
