ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE

This is a game implemented using Java's Swing library. The aim is to shoot down all the zombies that attack you over three interesting levels. With additional cheatcodes you can use a machine gun instead of a pistol or even an army tank.
The number of zombies and difficulty in defeating them increases as you progress to new levels.
I do not own the copyrights to the images used for the sprites. However I implemented all the logic and code myself.
I hope you enjoy it!
